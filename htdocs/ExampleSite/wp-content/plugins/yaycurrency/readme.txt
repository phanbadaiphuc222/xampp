It comes with advanced options that are readily configured via simple on/off switches.
Instead of showing the prices in a single currency, it allows your customers to change WooCommerce currency and choose the most convenient unit for them. 

###⚡️ FEATURES

**Sales Report**
Integrated WooCommerce multi-currency analytics allow you to view your store performance based on currency. Once filtered, you will easily see your total sales, leaderboards, orders, and top products sold in each currency. 

**Price Ending** 
Round the converted prices to your desired threshold and make them end in target figures (such as .49, .79, .99, and so on). Psychological pricing made easy. You can run live test calculations to be sure your settings go right.

**Multiple Currency Switcher Widgets**
Display the currency switcher at your store's optimal point. 
Even when you’re already using various widgets of chatbox, contact button, or other theme widgets, you still can find a sweet spot for the currency converter.

**Switchable During Checkout**
Allow switching currency during checkout and purchase transactions based on the local supported payment methods.

**Switcher on Product Pages**
Show the currency switcher dropdown next to Add to cart button on WooCommerce product pages, and other popups where your single product appears including Quickview, filters, etc.

**Customize Currency Display**
You can customize currency unit by choosing symbol or code, display the currency switcher before or after the short description, use shortcode to output the currency converter at your desired position, and more.


###💎 PREMIUM-ONLY FEATURES

**Unlimited Currencies**
It supports all currency units in the world including Bitcoin (BTC). You can add as many as you need.

**Price Based on Country**
Auto-detect the customer’s IP address and show the product prices in their local currency. You don't have to config anything as GeoIP services are readily built-in.

**Accept Checkout Payments in Different Currencies**
Based on your settings for each local currency, the order can be placed in the currency chosen by the user. And the product prices are also displayed in the selected currency in [order confirmation email templates](https://yaycommerce.com/customize-woocommerce-order-confirmation-email/).

**Auto-Update Exchange Rate**
Exchange rates are automatically updated on custom regular intervals and can also be manually forced.

###🔑 HOW IT WORKS

YayCurrency works seamlessly with all native WooCommerce payment methods.
Using Direct bank transfer, Check payments, Cash on delivery, PayPal Standard, or Stripe payment gateway? We got you covered!

- Choose your default currency in **WooCommerce** > **Settings** > **Currency options**.
- Then click on **Configure multi-currency** to start adding other currencies.
- When a new currency is added, it takes on the base WooCommerce default currency format including currency symbol position, thousand separator, decimal separator, and number of decimals.
- Then you can localize each currency by changing the formatting options in the currency's drawer panel.
